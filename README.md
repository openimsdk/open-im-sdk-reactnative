# React Native Client SDK for OpenIM 👨‍💻💬

Use this SDK to add instant messaging capabilities to your application. By connecting to a self-hosted [OpenIM](https://www.openim.io) server, you can quickly integrate instant messaging capabilities into your app with just a few lines of code.

The iOS SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an XCFramework for iOS integration. iOS interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, iOS utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).

The android SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an AAR file for Android integration. Android interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, Android utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).

The React Native Client SDK uses the [NativeModule](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro) system to expose instances of Java/Objective-C classes to JavaScript (JS) as JS objects, thereby allowing you to execute arbitrary native code from within JS.

## Tips 🔔

1. Starting from `v3.8.3-patch.10`, the package name has been changed from `open-im-sdk-rn` to `@openim/rn-client-sdk`.

2. **operationID Parameter:** This parameter is used for backend log querying. Starting from `v3.8.3-patch.10.2`, the `operationID` parameter is optional for all APIs (the SDK will auto-generate one if not provided). For earlier versions, this parameter is required and must be passed explicitly.

3. **Event Binding API:** Starting from `v3.8.3-patch.10.2`, you can use `OpenIMSDK.on()` to listen for events with better TypeScript type hints. Earlier versions must use the `OpenIMEmitter` object. Both approaches remain compatible with the latest version.

4. The `v3.5.1` contains ***significant disruptive updates***. If you need to upgrade, please check the incoming data and the returned data.

## Documentation 📚

Visit [https://docs.openim.io](https://docs.openim.io) for detailed documentation and guides.

For the SDK reference, see [https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/reactNative](https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/reactNative).

## Installation 💻

### Adding Dependencies

```sh
yarn add @openim/rn-client-sdk
```

## Usage 🚀

The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK. TypeScript is used, providing complete type hints.

### Importing the SDK and init

```typescript
import OpenIMSDK from '@openim/rn-client-sdk';
import RNFS from 'react-native-fs';

RNFS.mkdir(RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/tmp');

OpenIMSDK.initSDK({
  platformID: 2,  // 1: ios, 2: android
  apiAddr: 'http://your-server-ip:10002',
  wsAddr: 'ws://your-server-ip:10001',
  dataDir: RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/tmp',
  logFilePath: RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/tmp',
  logLevel: 5,
  isLogStandardOutput: true,
});
```

### Logging In and Listening for Connection Status

```typescript
import OpenIMSDK from '@openim/rn-client-sdk';

OpenIMSDK.login({
  userID: 'IM user ID',
  token: 'IM user token',
});

OpenIMSDK.on('onConnecting', () => {
  console.log('onConnecting');
});

OpenIMSDK.on('onConnectSuccess', () => {
  console.log('onConnectSuccess');
});

OpenIMSDK.on('onConnectFailed', ({ errCode, errMsg }) => {
  console.log('onConnectFailed', errCode, errMsg);
});
```

**For versions prior to v3.8.3-patch.10.2:**

```typescript
import OpenIMSDKRN, { OpenIMEmitter } from '@openim/rn-client-sdk';

OpenIMSDKRN.login({
  userID: 'IM user ID',
  token: 'IM user token',
}, 'opid');

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onConnecting', () => {
  console.log('onConnecting');
});

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onConnectSuccess', () => {
  console.log('onConnectSuccess');
});

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onConnectFailed', ({ errCode, errMsg }) => {
  console.log('onConnectFailed', errCode, errMsg);
});
```

To log into the IM server, you need to create an account and obtain a user ID and token. Refer to the [access token documentation](https://docs.openim.io/restapi/apis/usermanagement/userregister) for details.

### Receiving and Sending Messages 💬

OpenIM makes it easy to send and receive messages. By default, there is no restriction on having a friend relationship to send messages (although you can configure other policies on the server). If you know the user ID of the recipient, you can conveniently send a message to them.

```typescript
import OpenIMSDK from '@openim/rn-client-sdk';
import type { MessageItem } from '@openim/rn-client-sdk';

OpenIMSDK.on('onRecvNewMessages', (messages: MessageItem[]) => {
  console.log('onRecvNewMessages', messages);
});

const message = await OpenIMSDK.createTextMessage('hello openim');

OpenIMSDK.sendMessage({
  recvID: 'recipient user ID',
  groupID: '',
  message,
})
  .then(() => {
    // Message sent successfully ✉️
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // Failed to send message ❌
    console.log(err);
  });
```

**For versions prior to v3.8.3-patch.10.2:**

```typescript
import OpenIMSDKRN, { OpenIMEmitter } from '@openim/rn-client-sdk';

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onRecvNewMessages', (messages) => {
  console.log('onRecvNewMessages', messages);
});

const message = await OpenIMSDKRN.createTextMessage('hello openim', 'opid');

OpenIMSDKRN.sendMessage({
  recvID: 'recipient user ID',
  groupID: '',
  message,
}, 'opid')
  .then(() => {
    // Message sent successfully ✉️
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // Failed to send message ❌
    console.log(err);
  });
```

## Examples 🌟

You can find a demo web app that use the SDK in the [openim-reactnative-demo](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-reactnative-demo) repository.

or:

```sh
yarn

yarn example android

yarn example ios
```

> **Note for iOS:** When running the iOS example project, you may encounter dependency installation errors or build failures. Please refer to [iOS Example Project Running Notes](./docs/IOS-EXAMPLE-WARN.md) for detailed solutions.
