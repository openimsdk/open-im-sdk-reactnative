# React Native Client SDK for OpenIM 👨‍💻💬

Use this SDK to add instant messaging capabilities to your application. By connecting to a self-hosted [OpenIM](https://www.openim.io) server, you can quickly integrate instant messaging capabilities into your app with just a few lines of code.

The iOS SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an XCFramework for iOS integration. iOS interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, iOS utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).

The android SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an AAR file for Android integration. Android interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, Android utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).

The React Native Client SDK use [NativeModule](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro) system exposes instances of Java/Objective-C classes to JavaScript (JS) as JS objects, thereby allowing you to execute arbitrary native code from within JS.

## Tips 🔔

1. The open-im-sdk-rn@3.5.1 has contains ***significant disruptive updates***. If you need to upgrade, please check the incoming data and the returned data.

2. Unlike other SDKS, React Native SDK operationID is not optional, but required.

## Documentation 📚

Visit [https://doc.rentsoft.cn](https://doc.rentsoft.cn) for detailed documentation and guides.

For the SDK reference, see [https://doc.rentsoft.cn/sdks/quickstart/reactnative](https://doc.rentsoft.cn/sdks/quickstart/reactnative).

## Installation 💻

### Adding Dependencies

```sh
yarn add open-im-sdk-rn
```

### For android add following urls to build gradle:

https://open-im-online.rentsoft.cn:51000/repository/maven2/

```gradle
// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
buildscript {
    ext {
        buildToolsVersion = "33.0.0"
        minSdkVersion = 21
        compileSdkVersion = 33
        targetSdkVersion = 33

        // We use NDK 23 which has both M1 support and is the side-by-side NDK version from AGP.
        ndkVersion = "23.1.7779620"
    }
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            allowInsecureProtocol = true
            url 'https://open-im-online.rentsoft.cn:51000/repository/maven2/'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle")
        classpath("com.facebook.react:react-native-gradle-plugin")
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            allowInsecureProtocol = true
            url 'https://open-im-online.rentsoft.cn:51000/repository/maven2/'
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage 🚀

The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK. TypeScript is used, providing complete type hints.

### Importing the SDK and init

```typescript
import OpenIMSDKRN from 'open-im-sdk-rn';
import RNFS from 'react-native-fs';

RNFS.mkdir(RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/tmp');

OpenIMSDKRN.initSDK({
  platformID: 2,  // 1: ios, 2: android
  apiAddr: 'http://your-server-ip:10002',
  wsAddr: 'ws://your-server-ip:10001',
  dataDir: RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath + '/tmp',
  logLevel: 5,
  isLogStandardOutput: true,
}, 'opid');
```

### Logging In and Listening for Connection Status

```typescript
import OpenIMSDKRN, { OpenIMEmitter } from 'open-im-sdk-rn';

OpenIMSDKRN.login({
  userID: 'IM user ID',
  token: 'IM user token',
}, 'opid');

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onConnecting', () => {
  console.log('onConnecting');
});

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onConnectSuccess', () => {
  console.log('onConnectSuccess');
});

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onConnectFailed', ({ errCode, errMsg }) => {
  console.log('onConnectFailed', errCode, errMsg);
});
```

To log into the IM server, you need to create an account and obtain a user ID and token. Refer to the [access token documentation](https://doc.rentsoft.cn/restapi/userManagement/userRegister) for details.

### Receiving and Sending Messages 💬

OpenIM makes it easy to send and receive messages. By default, there is no restriction on having a friend relationship to send messages (although you can configure other policies on the server). If you know the user ID of the recipient, you can conveniently send a message to them.

```typescript
import OpenIMSDKRN, { OpenIMEmitter } from 'open-im-sdk-rn';
import type { MessageItem } from 'open-im-sdk-rn';

OpenIMEmitter.addListener('onRecvNewMessages', (data: MessageItem[]) => {
  console.log('onRecvNewMessages', data);
});

const message = await OpenIMSDKRN.createTextMessage('hello openim', 'opid');

OpenIMSDKRN.sendMessage({
  recvID: 'recipient user ID',
  groupID: '',
  message,
}, 'opid')
  .then(() => {
    // Message sent successfully ✉️
  })
  .catch(err => {
    // Failed to send message ❌
    console.log(err);
  });
```

## Examples 🌟
